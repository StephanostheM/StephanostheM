- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @StephanostheM
  I am a musician and multimedia expert based in Lisbon. I have worked before especially on optical discs (ample experience), especially on audio and video discs established after DVD-Video.
  (From time I still hold one active patent.)
  I have also ample experience in surround sound, including 3D / immersive audio.
  Regarding VR/XR, I see this as a special form of multimedia.
